# Supermarket Customer Analysis Challenge
(Title to be updated)

## Description
This project focuses on a dataset of supermarket customer data from a well-established retail food company. The company serves nearly one million consumers annually, with several hundred thousand registered customers. Its product portfolio spans five major categories: wines, rare meat products, exotic fruits, specially prepared fish, and sweet products, further classified into gold and regular tiers. Customers access these products through three sales channels: physical stores, catalogs, and the company’s website.

Despite achieving solid revenues and maintaining a healthy bottom line over the past three years, the company faces challenges in sustaining profit growth for the next three years. To address this, several strategic initiatives are under consideration, particularly enhancing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

The project aims to apply unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers effectively. By identifying clusters, the project will provide insights into customer characteristics and suggest potential business strategies for improved marketing outcomes.

### Goal:
The goal is to perform clustering analysis to segment customers based on their demographic, spending behavior, and other features.
This will help identify customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.

### Objectives
Key Objectives are:
1. Explore the data – be creative and pay attention to the details. You need to provide the marketing team a better understanding of the characteristic features of respondents;
2. Propose and describe a customer segmentation based on customers behaviors;
3. Create a predictive model which allows the company to maximize the profit of the next marketing campaign.
4. Whatever else you think is necessary.
